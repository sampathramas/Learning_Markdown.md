## How to create headings
To create a heading we need to start a line with a # followed by a space. Sub-headings can be created by using two hashes, eg ##. Several levels of headings can be created by adding more hashes.

To start a new paragraph we need to press enter twice.

To italisize text we add an asterisk on each side of the text, for example, *this text should be italisized*


By adding two asterisks on each side the text will be rendered as bold: **This text should be bold**

***By adding three asterisks on each side of the text, the text will be displayed as bold and italisized.***
